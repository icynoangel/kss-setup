# KSS Setup

This is a setup example for KSS using gulp

# It uses the following:

1. kss
2. gulp
3. csstyle
4. node-sass

# What does it do:

1. It provides a fully configured package to run kss 
2. It automatically copies dependencies (fonts and images) from src
3. It rebuilds and reloads on code changes
4. Handles node-sass and csstyle.io (BEM syntax)
5. It provides a sample of css folder structure and files

# Steps to install and run
